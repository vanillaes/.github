## Introduction

Welcome to the Vanilla ECMAScript Modules (ESM) organization. This is a collective of independent Open Source devs with one goal. To create, share, and promote the use of completely vanilla ESM implementations.

## Repositories

- [Absurdum (L)][] - A functional operator lib but every operator is implemented using reduce
- [Computer-Science (L)][] - Algorithms and Data Structures implemented with modern JS
- [CSV (L)][] - A small, fast, RFC4180 compliant CSV parser
- [Interpolate (L)][] - A tagged template literals parser
- [FrontMeta (L)][] - A FrontMatter parser for `key:value` metadata
- [JQKill (C)][] - A linter that locates all references to JQuery
- [Mock-Console (L)][] - Mock `console` (ie log, info, error) for testing
- [Tape-ES (C)][] - An ESM-compatible Tape.js test runner
